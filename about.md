Welcome! One day I will get around to populating this site with content
and updates about various projects I\'m working on.

I'm currently based in London, working for an awesome company called [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com).
Together, we're building the best bank in the world.

Previously, I worked at [Dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com) where I was a Full-Stack Engineer working
on various projects including data analysis, live esports, user experience design and micro-service implementations.

I founded [TrackDota](https://www.trackdota.com) with [Tim Sergeant](https://www.timsergeant.com) in 2014.

I\'m no longer available for freelance web development, but I\'ll be happy to
refer you to someone if you need those services. 

You can get in touch with me in the following ways:

* Email: [me@tsai.co](mailto:me@tsai.co)
* Twitter: [@watbe](http://twitter.com/watbe)

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
