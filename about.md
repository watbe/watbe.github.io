Currently, I'm based in London working for an awesome company called [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com).
Together, we're building the best bank in the world. Follow us at [@monzo](http://twitter.com/monzo).

Previously, I've worked at [Dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com) where I was a Full-Stack Engineer.
I led projects related to data analysis, esports, frontend and backend development, and built with microservices.

I founded [TrackDota](https://www.trackdota.com) with [Tim Sergeant](https://www.timsergeant.com) in 2014.

I'm no longer available for freelance web development, but I'll be happy to
refer you to someone if you need those services. 

You can get in touch with me in the following ways:

* Email: [me@tsai.co](mailto:me@tsai.co)
