Welcome! One day I will get around to populating this site with content
and updates about various projects I\'m working on.

I currently live in sunny Sydney and work full-time for [DOTABUFF](http://www.dotabuff.com/pages/about);
a great company all about Dota statistics. My role as software engineer includes programming,
testing, playing, and dreaming up new ideas to work on.

I\'m no longer available for freelance web development, but I\'ll be happy to
refer you to someone if you need those services. If you are interested in
photography services, please get in touch for more details.

You can get in touch with me in the following ways:

* Email: [wayne@tsai.co](mailto:wayne@tsai.co)
* Skype: waynetsai.nz
* Twitter: [@watbe](http://twitter.com/watbe)
* Phone: Ask me ;)
