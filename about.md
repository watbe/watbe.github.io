I'm currently building my own product, stay tuned! 

Previously, I worked for Apple Pay (Server Engineering) in London.

Before that, I worked on Payments at [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com), UK's leading [neobank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neobank).

I've also worked at [Elo Entertainment](https://www.elo.io/) where I helped build a range of gaming statistics websites.

You can get in touch with me in the following ways:

* Email: [me@tsai.co](mailto:me@tsai.co)
* Bluesky: [@watbe.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/watbe.dev)

This site is compiled by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
